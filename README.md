# personal-projects
This repository contains the stable versions of the personal projects I created for my own experience.
It currently contains the following projects:
- IBA Website: a full-stack recreation of the iba-world.com website created from scratch by myself.
- Sudoku Solver in C: a C implementation of a backtracking Sudoku-solving algorithm.
- SHA256 C Implementation: a C implementation of the SHA256 hashing function.
